%TODO: Abstract

The expansion of photovoltaic (PV) installations calls for efficient systems to monitor and evaluate their distribution and performance. High-resolution aerial imaging provides precise detection but is highly inaccessible in terms of availability and expense. In contrast, low-resolution satellite imagery is abundant but insufficient for accurate PV detection due to its low geographic resolution. This thesis suggests using generative artificial intelligence (AI) models to produce synthetic super-resolution (SR) images from low-resolution satellite data. The goal is to improve PV detection accuracy while lowering the costs associated with collecting high-resolution imagery. Geographically, the study will focus on select areas of Germany with high-resolution aerial and low-resolution satellite photographs available to confirm the proposed method's effectiveness.
