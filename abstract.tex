%TODO: Abstract
The proliferation of photovoltaic (PV) installations necessitates efficient monitoring systems to assess their distribution and performance. High-resolution aerial imagery offers precise detection but is limited by availability and cost. Conversely, low-resolution satellite imagery is abundant yet insufficient for accurate PV detection due to its low spatial resolution. This thesis proposes leveraging generative artificial intelligence (AI) models to generate synthetic super-resolution images from low-resolution satellite data. The research will involve tasks such as preprocessing and data preparation, generative machine learning model development, production of super-resolution images, and evaluation using defined metrics. PV detection will be performed using these enhanced images to assess the effectiveness of the approach. The study aims to enhance PV detection accuracy while minimizing costs associated with high-resolution imagery acquisition, focusing on regions in Germany where both high-resolution aerial and low-resolution satellite images are available.
